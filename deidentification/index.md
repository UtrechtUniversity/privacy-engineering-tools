## De-identification

De-identification is the process of making a dataset less identifiable or even anonymous. This can consist of completely removing identifiable information, generalizing data points (e.g., replace birth date with age), replacing identifiable values with non-sensitive ones, etc.
For a comprehensive overview of what de-identification is and how it can be applied to research data, please refer to the [Data Privacy Handbook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/pseudonymisation-anonymisation.html){target="_blank"}.

We have divided the de-identification tools into three major groups; one that can be used with [Python](deidentification/deidentification-python.md),
or [R](deidentification-r.md)
and one category for which [no programming](deidentification/deidentification-other.md) is required (complete software packages for example).
