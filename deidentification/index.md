## De-identification

De-identification is the process of making a dataset less identifiable or even anonymous. This can consist of completely removing identifiable information, generalizing data points (e.g., replace birth date with age), replacing identifiable values with non-sensitive ones, etc.
For a comprehensive overview of what de-identification is, see the privacy handbook [link needed].

We have divided the de-identification tools into three major groups; one that can be used with [Python](deidentification/deidentification-python.md),
or [R](deidentification-r.md)
and one category for which [no programming](deidentification/deidentification-other.md) is required (complete software packages for example).
