# Deidentification Tools using R

The following R packages are available for deidentifying data, or checking how well data are deidentified:

| Name | Description | Data type | Privacy models | Other features | Maintenance | GitHub stars | More info | License |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [sdcMicro](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/sdcapp-microdata.html) | [Open source](https://github.com/sdcTools/sdcMicro) [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/index.html) and [web app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/sdcapp-microdata.html) to apply Statistical Disclosure techniques such as generalization, top- and bottom coding and recoding to microdata. Note that the web app can be used locally without an internet connection. | Tabular data (.Rdata, .sav, .sasb7dat, .csv, .txt, .dta) | k-anonymity | Allows to explore, modify and analyse microdata, gives information about disclosure risks and information loss. You can also export all output and the underlying R code from the web app so that the anonymization process is reproducible. | Active | 10-100 | [Documentation](https://sdctools.github.io/sdcMicro/articles/sdcMicro.html), [demo](https://youtu.be/JeJ6OOxXZwo?t=5602) | [GPL-v2](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-2) |
| [Datacheck](https://libscie.github.io/datacheck-website/) | [Open source](https://github.com/libscie/datacheck) [R package](https://libscie.github.io/datacheck/index.html) (not published on CRAN yet) and a (more limited) web app that checks for presence of common identifiers in tabular datasets. Note that the web app can currently only run in Chrome and Edge browsers as the app is run locally. | Tabular data (CSV) | - | Checks for the following identifiers in a dataset: Email Address, IPv4, IPv6, MAC Address, Phone Number, Browser User Agent, Latitude Longitude (location), Gender (marginalized groups only, e.g., nonbinary, trans), Social security number, Birthday, Blood Type, IBAN Bank account, Creditcard, Amazon MTurk ID. The R package can check entire folders instead of 1 file at a time. **Important note**: neither names or indirect identifiers are detected. So even if the web app says a datafile is "safe to share", it may not be! | Active | 0-10 | [Project report and demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5Pa3Sx3n14) | [MIT](https://libscie.github.io/datacheck/LICENSE.html) |
