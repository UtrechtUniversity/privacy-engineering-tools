# File dictionary

This is for now a temporary file in which I track the consistency in wording and structuring tables across this repository.
I am not saying that these rules are already applied in the repository :)

Work In Progress!

## Minimal requirements for the tool list

For each tool, include at minimum:
- Title and link to software/tool
- A short description: what does the software do?
- Mention if the software is open source and if so, include the link

## Preferable components to include

We prefer that you also include:
- Maintenance: how actively is the software maintained? 
  - Levels: Active (last commit was less than a year ago) / Inactive (last commit was more than a year ago)
- Number of GitHub stars (this may not always be relevant however)
  - Levels: 0-10, 10-100, 100-500, 500-1000, 1000+
- License + a link to the license if possible
  - We've already come across: MIT / GPL-v3 / Apache 2.0 / BSD-3 Clause / BSD-2 Clause / BSD-3 Clause-Clear / Missing
- More information: where can researchers find more information? Think of documentation, tutorials, articles, demonstrations, etc.
  - Please make sure you are using persistent identifers where possible, e.g. for a journal article a DOI is preferable.

## More detailed information to include

Dependent on the type of tool, a more structured display of features of the tool may be desired. For example:

- What methods does the tool use (e.g., privacy models, generative models)?
- For what type of data are these tools useful?
- Who are the target audience of the tool?
- What is the result of using the tool? This is especially useful for synthetic data tools.
