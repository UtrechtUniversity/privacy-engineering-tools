# Other ways to create synthetic data 

Besides R and Python packages, there are other ways synthetic data can be created. This is the start of an overview of these other ways. 

**Please note: Very Much Work In Progress!**

## Dummy data

If you're merely interested in creating fake data to test your programming script on, you likely do not need realistic data. 

- Qualtrics has an option to [Generate test responses](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/generating-test-responses/): no programming required!

## Companies
There are many companies that offer services to create synthetic data, often including a utility and privacy report and often using Artificial Intelligence. On some company's website, you can try out their algorithms for free. 

Here are some examples, although this is by far not an exhaustive list:

- [Clearbox AI](https://www.clearbox.ai/) offers a free demo of their algorithm for tabular data (csv), up to 10 MB and 3 syntetic data projects per week.
- [Syntho](https://www.syntho.ai/) is a paid service.
- [Mostly AI](https://mostly.ai/) lets you create 100K rows of synthetic tabular data per day for free.
- The company Synthetized has a [Scientific Data Kit](https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/): a Python package with a free 30-day trial.
- [MDClone](https://www.mdclone.com/research) is a US-based company that generates health-care data. They provide a free demo on request.
