## Synthetic data

Synthetic data can be a great way make your data less identifiable. It works by creating a new dataset with new people that are not 1 on 1 related to people in the real dataset, thus delivering a level of anonimity, while hopefully retaining some (statistical) properties of the original dataset. For a more detailed overview and some of the possible pitfalls of these types of methods, see the [Synthetic data section in the Data Privacy Handbook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/synthetic-data.html){target="_blank"}.

We have categorized the synthetic data tools in three categories: [R](synthetic-simulated-data/synthetic-simulated-r.md), [Python](synthetic-simulated-data/synthetic-simulated-python.md) and [Other](synthetic-simulated-data/synthetic-simulated-other.md), which includes mostly commercial solutions to producing synthetic data.
