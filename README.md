# An overview of privacy engineering tools

Welcome! In this repository we are creating an overview of useful privacy engineering tools, i.e., tools to make it easier to handle personal data. For example, we are collecting useful packages/tools to help anonymise and pseudonymise personal data, but also to create synthetic micro-data. 

This repository is part of the <a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject" target="_blank">Data Privacy Project</a>, an RDM Support project at Utrecht University that aims to improve information, tools and services surrounding personal data in research.

- [Deidentification Tools](/deidentification-tools.md)
- [Python tools](/python.md)
