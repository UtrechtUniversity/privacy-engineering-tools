# Secure computing tools

Here is a start of a list of tools, initiatives and communities that (are looking to) apply code-to-data techniques. 
Note: this is a Work In Progress, please let us know if you have suggestions for improvement.

|----|---|---|---|---|
| [DataSHIELD](https://www.datashield.org) | DataSHIELD | [open source software](https://github.com/datashield) (R libraries) | Software for the privacy-preserving analysis of biomedical, healthcare and social-science data. Crucially, the data remain secure behind the firewalls on the system where they usually reside, and under the complete control of their primary custodian. It uses the distributed approach that allows the analysis of sensitive individual-level data from one study, and the co-analysis of such data from several studies simultaneously without physically pooling them or disclosing any data. DataSHIELD has a partnership with Vantage6 to make the extensive DataSHIELD toolset available through Vantage6. | [Tutorials](https://www.datashield.org/help/get-started/newcomers-workshop), [wiki](https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/overview) |
| [Vantage6](https://distributedlearning.ai) | Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland | [open source software](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6) (Python) | Vantage6 = priVAcy preserviNg federaTed leArninG infrastructurE for Secure Insight eXchange. Answering many of the questions in health care often requires incorporating data that are located at different sources. Typically, data from different parties are analyzed by centralizing them. That is, data are brought to where the algorithms are. Unfortunately, this raises heavy concerns regarding the privacy and security of sensitive patient data. By bringing algorithms to where the data are, the potential of multiple datasets are maximized while data leaks and privacy risks are minimized. | [Documentation](https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/) |
| [SURF Data Exchange](https://www.surf.nl/en/data-exchange-trusted-data-sharing) | SURF| [open source prototype](https://github.com/sara-nl/data-exchange/)| Prototype, see SURF Secure ANalysis Environment (SANE) for further developments||
| [Secure ANalysis Environment (SANE)](https://www.surf.nl/en/news/sane-secure-data-environment-for-social-sciences-and-humanities) | SURF| initiative in development, expected to go into production in 2024 | Virtual container in which the researcher can analyse sensitive data, but the data owner retains full control. SANE comes in 2 variants: Tinker SANE allows the researcher to see and manipulate the data. In Blind SANE, the researcher submits an algorithm without being able to see the data and the data provider approves the algorithm and the output. ||
| [Microdata CBS](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/onze-diensten/customised-services-microdata/microdata-conducting-your-own-research)| CBS | service| Microdata are linkable data at the level of individuals, companies and addresses which can be made available to Dutch universities, scientific organisations, planning agencies and statistical authorities within the EU under strict conditions for statistical research. The guiding principle here is safeguarding privacy and preventing disclosure of persons or companies. ||
| [Personal Health Train](https://www.health-ri.nl/initiatives/personal-health-train)| Health-RI| initiative which has resulted in Vantage6 software| Connecting health data for health care and research. The Personal Health Train (PHT) is designed to enable health care innovators and researchers to work with health data from various sources. It can give controlled access to data, while ensuring privacy protection and optimal engagement of individual patients and citizens.Modern health research generates and requires vast amounts of data captured and stored at different locations. Managing these data in a centralized database is neither desirable nor feasible. Central data processing gives rise to issues on agreements for data-accessibility, data standardization and privacy. Researchers found ways to use health data from various sources in decentralized databases. ||
| [Data safe haven](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/data-safe-haven)| The Alan Turing Institute| [open source](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven) infrastructure-as-code tools and framework for creating secure environments to analyse sensitive data | Open-source framework for creating secure environments to analyse sensitive data. It provides a set of scripts and templates that will allow you to deploy, administer and use your own secure environment. The framework provides a set of instructions to set up a secure environment with some default security controls. It is designed to be deployed on a Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform and consists of a Safe Haven Management component and one or more Secure Research Environments. Please note that the system first needs to be deployed by local IT before you can use it across operating systems.| [Documentation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/data-safe-haven/)|
| [Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation](https://coinstac.org/) (COINSTAC) | Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science | [open source software](https://github.com/trendscenter/coinstac)| A federated learning solution allowing users to run analyses locally and synchronize their analysis results to the cloud to undergo aggregate analyses. COINSTAC was originally developed for applying federated learning to neuroimaging datasets, but can also be used for other types of data and additionally applies differentially private algorithms.| [Documentation](https://trendscenter.github.io/coinstac/), [Releases](https://github.com/trendscenter/coinstac/releases), [Paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00365), [Installation instructions](https://github.com/trendscenter/coinstac-instructions) |
| [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) | OpenMined| community| OpenMined is a remote data science community. They not only provide a platform for connecting with experts on remote data science, but also maintain several remote data science open source software libraries and provide open educational materials on this topic. | [Community on slack](https://slack.openmined.org/), [courses](https://courses.openmined.org/), [OpenMined on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenMined)|
