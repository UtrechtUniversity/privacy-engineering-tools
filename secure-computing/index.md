# Secure computing

The software presented in this section are tools that help researchers keep the data safe. Examples of those are encryption and frameworks/tools to transfer data/information from one location to another without compromising data safety. For more information on secure computing see the section in the [data privacy handbook](link needed).

This section is split into two files: one for [encryption](secure-computing/encryption.md) and the [other](secure-computing/secure-computing.md) for tools that are not directly related to encryption.
