# Secure computation and storage

The tools presented in this section are tools that can help you keep your research data safe during storage and computation:

- The [encryption tools](secure-computing/encryption.md) listed in our overview can encrypt files, folders and/or drives while data are stored ("at rest"). You can read more about encryption in the [encryption section of the Data Privacy Handbook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/encryption.html)
- The [secure computing tools](secure-computing/secure-computing.md) are software, frameworks,or communities for keeping data safe in the analysis phase of a project. For more information on secure computation, see the [Secure computation chapter in the Data Privacy Handbook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/secure-computing.html).

We did not include tools for applying **differential privacy** (DP), but a list of DP tools can be found in the [awesome privacy engineering repository](https://github.com/mplspunk/awesome-privacy-engineering#differential-privacy-and-federated-learning). Additionally, there is an entire community of open source DP libraries: [OpenDP](https://opendp.org/).
