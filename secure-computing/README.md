# Secure computing

The software presented in this section are tools that help researchers keep their research data safe. Examples of those are [encryption](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/encryption.html){target="_blank"} and frameworks/tools to securely perform computations on the data, without compromising data safety. For more information on secure computing, see the [Secure computing section in the Data Privacy Handbook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/secure-computing.html){target=""_blank"}.

This section is split into two files: one for [encryption](secure-computing/encryption.md) and the [other](secure-computing/secure-computing.md) for tools that are not directly related to encryption.
